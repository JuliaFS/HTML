                <h1><strong>History</strong></h1>
                <p>In 1980, physicist <b>Tim Berners-Lee</b>, <sup>who was a contractor at CERN</sup>, proposed and <i>prototyped ENQUIRE</i>,
                    a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo
                    proposing an <i>Internet-based hypertext system</i>.[2] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser
                    and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer
                    Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally
                    adopted by CERN. In his personal notes[3] from 1990 he listed[4] <sub>"some of the many areas in which
                    hypertext is used"</sub> and put an encyclopedia first.

                <h1><strong>Elements</strong></h1>
                <p>
                    HTML documents imply a structure of nested HTML elements. These are indicated in the document by
                    HTML tags, enclosed in angle brackets thus: &#60;p&#62;. In the simple, general case, the extent of an element
                    is indicated by a pair of tags: a 'start tag' &#60;p&#62; and 'end tag' . The text content of the element, if
                    any, is placed between these tags. Tags may also enclose further tag markup between the start and end,
                    including a mixture of tags and text. This indicates further, nested, elements, as children of the parent element.
                    The start tag may also include attributes within the tag. These indicate other information, such as
                    identifiers for sections within the document, identifiers used to bind style information to the
                    presentation of the document, and for some tags such as the &#60;img&#62; used to embed images, the
                    reference to the image resource.
                    Some elements, such as the line break &#60;br&#62;, do not permit any embedded content, either text or further tags.
                    These require only a single empty tag (akin to a start tag) and do not use an end tag.
                    Many tags, particularly the closing end tag for the very commonly-used paragraph element &#60;p&#62;, are optional.
                    An HTML browser or other agent can infer the closure for the end of an element from the context and
                    the structural rules defined by the HTML standard. These rules are complex and not widely understood
                    by most HTML coders.
                    The general form of an HTML element is therefore: &#60;tag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2"&#62;content
                    &#60;/tag&#62;. Some HTML elements are defined as empty elements and take the form &#60;tag attribute1="value1"
                    attribute2="value2" &#62;. Empty elements may enclose no content, for instance, the BR tag or the inline IMG tag.
                    The name of an HTML element is the name used in the tags. Note that the end tag's name is preceded by a slash
                    character, "/", and that in empty elements the end tag is neither required nor allowed.
                    If attributes are not mentioned, default values are used in each case.
